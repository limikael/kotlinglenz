A glenz vector in kotlin

This is a little effect made with Kotlin and OpenGL ES. It is based on the Kotlin OpenGL tuturial but with some extra stuff added:

- Some matrix multiplications for rotation and scaling.
- Vertex shader that can manipulate individual vertices.
- Some creative use of face culling and blending.
